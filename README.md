# Test the Module

**Test the Module** is a practical embedded systems learning series focused on
testing and understanding electronic modules, sensors, and microcontrollers
before using them in real projects.

The goal is simple:
> Verify hardware → Understand how it works → Learn how to code it

---

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Here

- Basic test codes for microcontrollers
- Module-specific testing programs
- Wiring / connection references
- Simple explanations of working and use-cases
- Clean and reusable code templates

---

## 🧠 Why Test First?

In embedded systems and robotics, faulty hardware or incorrect connections
can waste hours of debugging.

This repository helps you:
- Confirm hardware health
- Avoid false failures
- Build confidence before integration

## 📂 Structure

- `Arduino/` → Arduino board & module tests
- `ESP32/` → ESP32 board & module tests *(coming soon)*
- `STM32/` → STM32 board & module tests *(coming soon)*

Each module contains:
- Test code
- Connection details
- Explanation & use cases
